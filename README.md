To Do
-----
* Add menu page with instructions on how to play
* Add space/stars skybox in the background
* Add light outlines to the blue and red paddles (Tron-like effect)
* Add bot code for the red paddle so it can play too :)
* Add 3 or 4 sounds (ball bounce, ball hit paddle, ball miss paddle, power-up, etc..)
* Add scoreboard at the top like old-fashioned Pong
